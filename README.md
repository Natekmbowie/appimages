# appimages

A place for me to stash appimages and tools/scripts I use to assemble them. You're welcome to use them or build upon them if you would like. Anything made by me (i.e. scripts and configuration files) is licensed MIT, any code from the projects I use to assemble things from (and their dependencies) will likely have different licenses. If things get out of date or are broken feel free to ping me on the Fediverse @natebowie@mastodon.social, though most of the content here is less crucial to have the latest version of.

This is very much disorganized and a work in progress, you have been warned. I usually test in Arch and Debian, but no guarantees things will work.
